Hello, my name is Alfredo Aguiar Arce. I am a mechatronic engineer and programmer. I am familiar with languages like Python, C ++, Java, and JavaScript. I have experience with industrial applications such as PLC and assembly language for microprocessors.

I grew up in a small city with limited technology, it was not until my adolescence that I discovered the power of programming for me it was like learning to paint, since I could create things from nothing, simply using code, so I began to create Android applications for help me automate my homework.

Personally, these types of limitations in my city have led me to constantly continue learning online in a self-taught way on specialized platforms such as Platzi, being that I consider being self-taught as one of my best virtues, because I think that there are no impossible while it is available of an internet connection and an idea.

Once I finished my education as a programming technician, I did some freelance work, some of which I received offers to work in exchange for bitcoin that I rejected because I believed it was a scam ... probably having accepted those offers today I might have had a different learning path.

When I studied my university degree in engineer, I managed to unite my passion for programming with my knowledge in the area of mechatronics. That is where I also discovered and practiced my aptitudes for the area of electronics, physics and automation.

One of my interests in the future is to continue learning more about artificial intelligence and blockchain since from my point of view they are technologies of the future in the coming years. Well, after the progress that these technologies have had throughout my formative years, I believe more than before in the potential that all projects in these areas can have, to even develop new technologies.
I am excited to imagine the future that with all the technological scope that we cannot even conceive in our imagination, and how I would like to contribute on the way to that future.
